# Description of the assignment

My User Interface is a Sci-Fi control panel. My idea came from Prometheus, when they go down to a desolate planet and 3 people stay up in the ship monitoring them. 
Mine is slightely different as it is 3 people, on different parts of the planet. 

# Instructions
To UI is very simple to use. Simply hover over the 3 idividuals for their information. To make contact with them simply hold down the 'space bar' after clicking on their icons. The icon will change when you click on their icon. 
The buttons on the top are to either communicate with 1 person or 3 people. The second last icon is to show you the location of each individual on the planet. The settings button resets everything.

## CSV File
- The CSV file I used is Attributes.csv, whish contained the level of strengh etc. of the soldiers.
- The class Attributes.java is where get the details and get their values as local variables.
- In UI.java I load the table into an aray list called "attributes". I load and print the details in the same function ( void loadTable() ).

## Interactive ( Buttons )
- There are 8 buttons in my UI

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
